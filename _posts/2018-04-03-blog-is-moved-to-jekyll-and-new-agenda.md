## Blog is moved to new platform + New agenda + Status update

With this post I am proclamating another attempt to bring this blog to life :)

# Why now?

Well, few reasons for that:
* I need a place to practice my English writing skills (sorry for all the spelling; grammar, ect errors);
* I feel like I have something to say;
* There are some changes in my life - I moved to another country - which might be interesting and useful to document, even just for myself;
* Why not?

# What will change?

Not much. I want to believe that I will post more often, but, maybe, with less words.

No agenda for blog anymore. I will just throw in anything what will be in my head at the moment. Coding, lifestyle, sport, crazy ideas, politics, photos, links, reviews, tips, etc.... I expect a lot of trash, but hopefully sometimes I will be able to post something useful or interesting.

# Status update

I have moved to Australia (from Latvia) 9 months ago.

I have a new job - software developer at Atlassian.

# Some technical details about blog

Blog is still hosted on Github pages, but now is based on Jekyll (I am using [www.jekyllnow.com](http://www.jekyllnow.com)). 

Previously I generated blog using static blog generator I wrote myself.

I am still thinking where to wtite blog posts. Right now I am using [prose.io](https://prose.io). Seems OK, but grammarly does not work :(
