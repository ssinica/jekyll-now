This sucks! The world is soo inperfect.

Today I learned that there is no easy way to add tags to the Jekyll blog hosted/generated by Github Pages.

Probably, at some point in the future I will have to write my own blog engine. 

Again. 

In Go, of course. 

And by engine I mean - no more staticly generated sites. They are too limited. Only proper service with DB, API, monitoring, etc....
