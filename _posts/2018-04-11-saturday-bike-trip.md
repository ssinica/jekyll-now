Today is a Wednesday. But I am writing a post about a Saturday. My excuse is - I did not have much time during the weekend. Then I got cold. 

Now I feel a little bit better. Let's use this opportunity.

So. Saturday I decided to go on a longer bike trip. These are approximate directions: [link to Google Maps](https://www.google.com.au/maps/dir/Coles+Supermarkets/-33.8235436,151.1935156/-33.8044319,151.1932581/-33.7838223,151.1918025/-33.7639072,151.2057571/-33.7667725,151.2192915/-33.772363,151.2361044/-33.8012878,151.2461921/-33.8244766,151.2362725/-33.8375534,151.2091393/@-33.8039772,151.2037396,13.03z/data=!4m17!4m16!1m5!1m1!1s0x0:0xe845e99083125c5a!2m2!1d151.2089406!2d-33.8392266!1m0!1m0!1m0!1m0!1m0!1m0!1m0!1m0!1m0!3e1)

The total length around 30km. A lot of hills. Unknown suburbs. 

It took me 3 hours to complete the distance. Although, I did not try to go fast. My goal was to explore.

Some learnings from the trip:

* Road bike sucks. I really have to switch to mountain bike. 
* There are snakes in the Sydney area - saw my first wild snake in AU. I want to believe it was non-venomous python. Big one. More than a 1 meter long. Just lying near the highway.
* 1 liter of water is not enough. Next time I should take more water with me.
* I need a helmet with a visor. Sun is killing me!
* It is possible to navigate using only voice directions from Google Maps.
