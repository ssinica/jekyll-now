title: 3001: the final odyssey by Arthur Clarke
published: true

I just finished reading great book I can recommend - [3001: The final odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3001:_The_Final_Odyssey).

![3001:_The_Final_Odyssey]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/3001_odyssey.jpg)

This is a final book in the Space Odyssey series written by Arthur Clarke. The book can be a little bit boring sometimes (true for all books in the series), but still this a classic which must be read by any fiction-science fan. 

I really like an idea that human is just some space civilization experiment. It would be much more interesting than boring Darwin theory.

Anyway. Recommended!

What should I read next?...
